									<h2>Apollo Mission: A Giant Leap for Mankind</h2>
									<p>The Apollo mission stands as one of the most significant achievements in human
										history. It was a series of manned spaceflights conducted by NASA with the
										objective of landing astronauts on the Moon and returning them safely to Earth.
										The Apollo program spanned from 1961 to 1972 and consisted of several missions,
										with Apollo 11 being the iconic mission that achieved the first lunar landing in
										1969. Led by visionary leaders and supported by thousands of dedicated
										scientists, engineers, and astronauts, the Apollo mission represented a
										remarkable feat of engineering, perseverance, and human courage. The culmination
										of years of research, development, and training, Apollo not only demonstrated
										the technological prowess of the United States but also showcased the
										indomitable spirit of human exploration. The success of the Apollo mission
										marked a pivotal moment in history, inspiring generations and serving as a
										testament to what humanity can achieve when united by a common goal.</p>

							<h3><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/main/index.html"> Kepler Mission:
									Hunting for Exoplanets</a></h3>
							<p>Launched in 2009, the Kepler space telescope, operated by NASA, revolutionized our
								understanding of exoplanetsâ€”planets orbiting stars outside our solar system. Its primary
								goal was to survey a specific region of the Milky Way galaxy, monitoring the brightness
								of numerous stars to detect the periodic dimming caused by transiting exoplanets.
								Kepler's observations have resulted in the discovery of thousands of confirmed and
								potential exoplanets, including Earth-sized rocky worlds and gas giants in habitable
								zones. The Kepler mission has provided essential data for understanding the prevalence
								and diversity of exoplanets, bringing us closer to answering the age-old question: Are
								we alone in the universe?</p>
