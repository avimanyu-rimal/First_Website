							<h2>Hubble Space Telescope reveals a rare black hole lurking in our cosmic backyard</h2>
							<p>Astronomers have found a very tiny region jam-packed with the mass of 800 suns that is
								creating chaos among nearby stars, all of which points toward an intermediate-mass black
								hole just 6,000 light-years away in the constellation Scorpius. If the discovery pans
								out, it could add to the growing evidence that the universe is friendly toward such
								cosmic middleweights, only a handful of which have been found so far.

								"It's too tiny for us to be able to explain other than it being a single black hole,"
								Eduardo Vitral, an astrophysicist at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Maryland
								and lead author of an upcoming study about the finding, said in a statement on Tuesday
								(May 23). "Alternatively, there might be a stellar mechanism we simply don't know about,
								at least within current physics."</p>

						<p>A large chunk of black holes found so far — including the 100 million of them that call our
							Milky Way galaxy home — come in two sizes: Small black holes just 10 to 100 times the sun's
							mass, and gargantuan ones that are some millions or even billions of times heavier than the
							sun.

							Medium sized black holes, which astronomers think reside at the centers of small galaxies
							and feed on stars like messy toddlers, are much more elusive to spot and even tougher to
							confirm, thanks to lack of explanation for their formation and difficulties in weighing them
							accurately. While the evidence for numerous candidates remains inconclusive still, in 2014,
							astronomers confirmed one such mid-sized black hole lurked about 12 light-years away from
							Earth.

							Now, Vitral's team thinks it has spotted another such "gravitational pothole," this time
							much closer to home. After analyzing 12 years worth of Hubble Space Telescope data on a
							nearby star cluster called Messier 4 (or M4), astronomers say a mid sized black hole
							weighing some 800 solar masses may be making up the heart of M4, a past member of the Milky
							Way whose orbit now takes it around our galaxy once every 116 million years or so.

							Like all black holes, this latest one cannot be seen directly. Instead, the team used data
							from the European Space Agency's star-mapping Gaia spacecraft to study the chaotic motion of
							stars at M4's center, where they are trapped in the suspected black hole's gravitational
							field, "like bees swarming around a hive," team members wrote in the image description.While
							the black hole has yet to be confirmed, current models show that such a single, compact
							region of high mass cannot be formed with other processes. Vitral's team carried out
							numerical simulations to see if the mass of 800 suns could be created by a group of black
							holes or soon-to-be black holes like neutron stars or white dwarfs, and found that what
							Hubble spotted is more compact than what the simulations are able to produce.

							"If the object isn't a single intermediate-mass black hole, it would require an estimated 40
							smaller black holes crammed into a space only one-tenth of a light-year across to produce
							the observed stellar motions," team members wrote in the same statement. "The consequences
							are that they would merge and/or be ejected in a game of interstellar pinball."

							<h3><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jupiter-lightning-bolt-contort-earth">Jupiter
									lightning bolts contort the same way as Earth</a></h3>
							<p>On Jupiter, lightning jerks and jolts a lot like it does on Earth.

								Jovian lightning emits radio wave pulses that are typically separated by about one
								millisecond, researchers report May 23 in Nature Communications. The energetic
								prestissimo, the scientists say, is a sign that the gas giant’s lightning propagates in
								pulses, at a pace comparable to that of the bolts that cavort through our own planet’s
								thunderclouds. The similarities between the two world’s electrical phenomena could have
								implications for the search for alien life.Arcs of lightning on both worlds appear to
								move somewhat like a winded hiker going up a mountain, pausing after each step to catch
								their breath, says Ivana Kolmašová, an atmospheric physicist at the Czech Academy of
								Sciences in Prague. “One step, another step, then another step … and so on.”

								Here on Earth, lightning forms as turbulent winds within thunderclouds cause many ice
								crystals and water droplets to rub together, become charged and then move to opposite
								sides of the clouds, progressively generating static electrical charges. When the
								charges grow big enough to overcome the air’s ability to insulate them, electrons are
								released — the lightning takes its first step. From there, the surging electrons will
								repeatedly ionize the air and rush into it, lurching the bolt forward at an average of
								hundreds of thousands of meters per second.

								Scientists have suggested that superbolts observed in Jovian clouds might also form by
								collisions between ice crystals and water droplets (SN: 8/5/20). But no one knew whether
								the alien bolts extended and branched in increments, as they do on Earth, or if they
								took some other form.

								For the new study, Kolmašová and her colleagues used five years of radio wave data
								collected by NASA’s Juno spacecraft (SN: 12/15/22). Analyzing hundreds of thousands of
								radio wave snapshots, the team found radio wave emissions from Jovian lightning appeared
								to pulse at a rate comparable to that of Earth’s intracloud lightning — arcs of
								electricity that never strike ground.

								If bolts extend through Jupiter’s water clouds at a similar velocity as they do in
								Earth’s clouds, then Jovian lightning might branch and extend in steps that are hundreds
								to thousands of meters long.

							<h3><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/webb-telescope-asteroids-fomalhaut-star">The
									James Webb telescope revealed surprise asteroids in the Fomalhaut star system</a>
							</h3>
							<p>“It’s the first time we’re actually looking at the inner system, and it looks really
								different than I think anybody expected it to,” says astrophysicist Meredith MacGregor
								of the University of Colorado Boulder, who was not involved in the study. “The
								expectation was that there would be something like our solar system,” a place that is
								relatively mature and stable. “It really starts changing how we think about the dynamics
								of the [Fomalhaut] system.”

								Fomalhaut, a scant 25 light-years away, is a young star at the center of a rapidly
								evolving planetary system. It was once thought to host one of the first planets to be
								photographed outside of our solar system (SN: 11/13/08). However, the existence of the
								planet — dubbed Dagon — has long been in question (SN: 1/26/12).

								The new JWST images add to the growing evidence that Dagon is actually a cloud of dust.
								A collision among planets probably explains the dusty feature, says András Gáspár, an
								astronomer at the University of Arizona in Tucson. “It is fading, and it is expanding in
								size,” he says, as it follows a trajectory consistent with dust blowing in the stellar
								wind from Fomalhaut. Those are all characteristics more indicative of dust clouds than
								planets.

								But just because Dagon hasn’t seemed to have panned out, that doesn’t mean there aren’t
								other planets lurking around Fomalhaut.

								Indirect evidence for other worlds comes from an unexpected asteroid belt, seen for the
								first time in the new images. The belt is tilted at a jaunty 23 degrees from everything
								else seen in orbit around the star.

								“This is a truly unique aspect of the system,” Gáspár says. The tilted belt, he says,
								could be the result of as-yet-undiscovered planets stirring up the debris around
								Fomalhaut.

								MacGregor agrees. “If you see a disk that’s like this, that has an [elongated] outer
								ring and a bunch of dust that’s getting dragged in, there are probably planets there,”
								she says. “I think the easiest explanation [for the tilted belt] is there’s a planet in
								there, and the planet is on an orbit that is not aligned with the disk.” The misaligned
								planet, in turn, is dragging the asteroid belt off-kilter with respect to the plane of
								the solar system, she says.</p>

							<h3><a
									href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rocky-planets-early-universe-james-webb-telescope">Rocky
									planets might have been able to form in the early universe</a></h3>
							<p>The Small Magellanic Cloud is one of the Milky Way’s nearest galactic neighbors, though
								it’s very different from our galaxy. The tiny galaxy has a much lower abundance of heavy
								metal elements — such as iron, magnesium and aluminum — which are all crucial to the
								formation of rocky planets. This low-metal environment also mimics that of the early
								universe, an epoch before stars had enough time to forge the heavy elements and blow
								them out into space.

								Because of the lack of these elements, astronomers have been unsure if rocky planets are
								able to form in the Small Magellanic Cloud. And previous telescopes did not have the
								ability to really probe young stars with a mass less than or equal to that of the sun,
								so astronomers couldn’t measure the star systems’ dust content, which is needed to infer
								if planets could be being born. But with the sensitivity of the James Webb Space
								Telescope, or JWST, astronomers can now gather more light and see smaller, fainter stars
								in greater detail (SN: 12/7/22).

								Astrophysicist Olivia Jones and colleagues used an infrared camera on JWST to look at a
								region of the Small Magellanic Cloud called NGC 346, where young stars are forming.
								“It’s the first time ever we’ve really been able to look at how solar-size stars form in
								an environment akin to the early universe,” says Jones, of the Royal Observatory,
								Edinburgh.

								The team detected signatures that suggest that lots of dust is orbiting and falling
								toward hundreds of stars in the region. As these dust grains orbit, they could begin to
								stick together and eventually accrete to create rocky planets.

								“One of the things we would love to understand better is how the environmental context
								impacts star formation and then, later on, the planet-forming populations around those
								young, forming stars,” says Michael Meyer, an astronomer at the University of Michigan
								in Ann Arbor who was not involved in the research.

								Because the Small Magellanic Cloud is the nearest example of a cosmic region with a much
								different chemical composition than the Milky Way, he says, it provides the first
								touchstone to study how star and planet formation depend on the stellar environment.</p>
